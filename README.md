# Offshore Oil and Gas Energy System Operational Optimisation Model (oogeso)

Python module for modelling and analysing the energy system of offshore oil and gas fields, with renewable energy and storage integration.

Part of the [Low Emission Centre](https://www.sintef.no/en/projects/lowemission-research-centre/) (SP5).

## Getting started

Clone or download the code and install it as a python package. I.e. navigate to the folder with the MANIFEST.in file and type:  
`pip install --editable .`

(Installing as _editable_ means a link will be created from the python package directory to the code located here, and you can modify the code without the
need to re-install.)

Check out the examples:

* [Simple test case](examples/test case2.ipynb?viewer=nbviewer)
* [Test oil and gas platform](examples/TestPlatform.ipynb?viewer=nbviewer)

A user guide is provided together with  the code:

## Contribute
You are welcome to contribute to the improvement of the code.

* Use Issues to describe and track needed improvements and bug fixes
* Use branches to avoid messing things up -- but don't veer too far away from the trunk (master branch)
