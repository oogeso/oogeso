## Getting started

Clone or download the code and install it as a python package. Navigate to the folder with the MANIFEST.in file and type:
`pip install --editable .`

(Installing as _editable_ means a link will be created from the python package directory to the code located here, and you can modify the code without the
need to re-install.)
